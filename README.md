# dd_image_linux_py3
DD Image writer Utility
PLEASE USE CAUTION WHEN USING THIS...

First and foremost, I am not a seasoned developer. I made this with chatgpt and checked over it with my minor knowledge of python code and linux experience. 

I made this because I was tired of Googling "Windows 11 usb in linux". I am constantly switching back and forth and wanted a straightforward way to do it.

*TODO*

Add Bootable flag after image is done

Add progress
